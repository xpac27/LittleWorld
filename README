This programme is supposed to be able to compile and run on MacOSX, Linux and PC (I only tested MacOSX for now).

This project is under development so do not expect impressive features ;)


REQUIRED:

- g++ compiler (just install xcode if you are on mac)
- GLUT and OpenGL c++ library (just install xcode if you are on mac)
- SFML c++ library (http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/1.6/)
- Boost c++ library (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_0/more/getting_started/index.html)


INSTALLING:

- Git clone the LittleWorld project
- Go in the LittleWorld folder and type "make" then Enter and wait for the build to be done
- Type ./littleWorld to start the game


VERSION HISTORY:

- v0.1: basic rendering and game structure


NOTES:

- If the game do not compile because of some errors in the code reset the history to a stable revision (git reset --hard v0.1) then try again.
- If some build or link errors occure feel free to adjust the Makefile and to push your corrections, I designed it for my setup for now so it might certenly not work for every one.
